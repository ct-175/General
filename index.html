  <section id="description">
    <h2>1. Description</h2>
    <p>Fair trade is a **market-based aid approach**: certification, minimum prices, and social premiums paid by buyers to producer organizations (cooperatives). Typical actors: **certification bodies (e.g., Fairtrade), NGOs, ethical companies, and consumer markets**. Addressees are **smallholder farmers and worker communities** in low‑income countries.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="advantages">
    <h2>2. Advantages</h2>
    <p>Benefits include **higher and more stable incomes**, community development funds (premiums), improved bargaining power, and incentives for sustainable practices. Profits go to **producers, cooperatives, and local communities**.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="disadvantages">
    <h2>3. Disadvantages / Problems</h2>
    <p>Challenges: certification costs, limited market access, risk of dependency on niche markets, and uneven benefits within communities. Some producers face **bureaucratic burdens** and may be excluded if they cannot meet standards.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="example">
    <h2>4. Example</h2>
    <p>Case studies from **coffee and cocoa cooperatives** show improved incomes and governance for certified groups, but mixed results where market access or internal governance is weak.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>5. Conclusion & Recommendation</h2>
    <p>Recommendation: **continue and scale fair trade** where it strengthens cooperatives, pairs with training and market access programs, and reduces certification barriers for the poorest producers.</p>
